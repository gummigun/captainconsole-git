It’s a Battle Royale on wheels. All of the skill in the world isn’t going to save you or your spot in first place when some punk decides to fire a Blue shell your way. Beneath its colorful, cartoonish appearance, there lies a game so brutal it makes Mad Max look like bumper cars. This successor to Super Mario Kart was able to ditch the Mode 7 graphics for genuine 3D racetracks. With a grand total of 16 increasingly-challenging courses, crisscrossing every corner of the Mushroom Kingdom, and 8 playable Mario veterans behind the wheel, Mario Kart 64 is a title that never runs out of surprises. Whether it’s making hairpin turns on slippery ice sheets, dodging the crushing Thwomps that line the halls of Bowser’s castle, or stealing victory at the last second with a well-timed Mega Mushroom Speed Boost, Mario Kart 64 is loaded with peril at every turn. But even if you managed to master all the dastardly racetracks of the main game, Mario Kart 64’s Battle Mode is guaranteed to leave you with a white-knuckled grip on your controller. Forget about momentum; this game mode is four sadistic speedways designed to let you wreck anything that moves. So if you’re looking for a crash course in why the Nintendo 64 was the greatest multiplayer console ever made, look no further.

But then at the last minute, one of the developers had the idea to throw in a multiplayer mode, and a gaming legend was born. With over 40 playable characters, 32 devastating weapons, 11 treacherous death maps, 8 separate game modes, a metric ton of game-shattering cheat options, all at the disposal of up to 4 players at once made GoldenEye the greatest multiplayer game of its generation. The idea of four friends all clumped together on a couch, and staring at the same screen is a lost novelty these days. And that’s a shame. Games like GoldenEye really brought out a sense of comradery. It takes good humor, and some serious guts to laugh at the guy you just drove over with a digital tank, when they’re sitting two feet away from you. And focusing on just your quarter of the television screen, never knowing when your enemies would spring out to attack you was an experience that never let the tension ease up for a second...unless you were a dirty cheater who decided to look at where everyone else was standing and throw grenades at them like you were some sort of psychic demolitions expert. Either way, GoldenEye was endless fun to play and remains a title that will leave you shaken and stirred.', 2, 1, 1);

Diddy Kong Racing distinguishes itself as, well, a much more serious racing game. It rewards pure skill, over scoring an invincibility star power-up. Furthermore it allows you to explore its tracks in not one, but three separate vehicles: Cars, Hovercrafts, and Planes. That’s three different ways to experience every aspect of this masterfully crafted game. Each vehicle handles differently, and rewards you with new routes to explore, effectively making Diddy Kong Racing three whole games in one!

I mean, how many of us were really hoping that there was a game where that racecar driver from F-Zero could repeatedly punch the kid from Earthbound. But then somehow, out of nowhere, that game popped into existence. And it was the greatest thing ever. Super Smash Bros was a revolutionary game for two reasons. Firstly, it was Nintendo’s long overdue crossover game that brought together characters from its many franchises for one epic quest. It’s just that I think most of us thought that it would be something other than beating each other senseless. And secondly: Smash redefined what a fighting game could be. It took the two-dimensional combat of Street Fighter, but placed it in a variety of colorful stages that players could jump around like a traditional platformer. Then it took the usual one on one battle mechanics and tossed them out the window. Want Mario to use his special fireball move? Just press the “B” button. You want Mario to do a special uppercut move that makes his opponents explode into golden coins? Yeah, that’s a trickier one; press “Up and B.” There were no fancy inputs for super moves, up to four people could play at the same time, and they gave you items to use against opponents. And, what items they were! Pokeballs, Warp Stars, Invincibility Stars, explosive Bob-ombs, proximity mines, ray guns, Super Hammers and more! And the fighting arenas were all plucked from the greatest video game levels across the Nintendo universe. Get your buddies together, choose an adorable cartoon mascot, and then send them to lava-filled depths of Planet Zebes to fight until only one is left standing. Not extreme enough? How about the vacuum of space, on top of Star Fox’s mothership, while Arwings indiscriminately fire lasers at everyone? Too much? Try out Kirby’s Dreamland. It has a tree that can make the wind blow against you...every time you’re trying to avoid falling down a bottomless pit. Was it fair game? No. Was it balanced? Heck, no! Was it fun? Undeniably.

This may be the first N64 game to feature fully rendered lens flares. However, the star of the show is undoubtedly the water. You think that’s a joke? Even today, developers have trouble making water look real. In wave Race 64 it not only looks real, it feels real! Each wave is unique and presents its own swell and crash for players to navigate. During sunny afternoons, the calm ocean is a crystaline blue that allows you to see pods of dolphins frolicking beneath the surface. Those same digital waters visibly darken and turn choppy in stormier weather. As evening approaches, the entire sea takes on a gorgeous sun-kissed hue. That level of detail was completely unprecedented in 1996, and still looks amazing over two decades later. But as fun as it is to stare at imaginary water, a racing game is still only as good as its gameplay. And wow, does Wave Racer 64 deliver! This is a title made for the N64. The whole game is built around the controller’s analog joystick, which rolls effortlessly along the crest of every wave. Crashing into obstacles flings you off your jet ski. Crashing into other racers knocks them off their jet ski. Making sharp turns at full speed is exhilarating, as you try to push your momentum as far as it will go without capsizing yourself. And, the ability to alter your jet ski ‘s attributes to match your play style created endless customization possibilities. In addition to the core arcade mode, Wave Race 64 includes time trials and a stunt mode. The game also sports the obligatory two-player mode that lets you race against friends.

The game drops players right into the action, by battling their way off the ice planet, Hoth, both on foot and by Snowspeeder. From there, players fought against Boba Fett, in a desperate attempt to reclaim Han Solo’s Carbonite frozen body. They saved Luke Skywalker from a band of assassins. And as each mission unfolded, players began to uncover a far darker conspiracy: a secret plot to destabilize the entire galaxy, and at its heart, the sinister Prince Xizor. In terms of gameplay, Shadows of the Empire had a little bit of everything. There were fast-paced races on hover-bikes, exciting dogfights between star ships, and 3D platforming levels where players guided Dash on foot, while using his trusty jetpack to avoid enemy fire.
